# Functional API with Keras for Classification

This project demonstrates building a classification model using **Keras Functional API**, which allows for flexible, non-linear model architectures. The task involves classifying images using a CNN-based model trained via augmented image batches.

### **Key Insights:**

* Functional API allows for more complex architectures beyond sequential stacking.
* Real-time data augmentation is used via `ImageDataGenerator` to improve generalization.
* Training process is visualized using accuracy and loss curves.
* Model performance is validated using validation data split and evaluated per epoch.
