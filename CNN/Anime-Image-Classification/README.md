# Anime Character Classification with CNN

This project builds and trains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify anime characters from image data. The model is designed and trained from scratch using PyTorch, handling grayscale input images and predicting classes with a softmax classifier.

### **Key Insights:**
- Dataset preprocessing involved reshaping and normalizing input tensors with shape `(batch_size, 1, 64, 64)` for grayscale images.
- CNN model includes `Conv2D`, `ReLU`, and `MaxPooling` layers to extract spatial features.
- Achieved non-trivial accuracy despite limited dataset size, demonstrating effectiveness of basic CNN architecture.
- Used forward hooks to inspect output tensor shapes through layersâ€”useful for debugging and understanding internal transformations.
