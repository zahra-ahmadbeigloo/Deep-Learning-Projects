# Simple Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple CNN from scratch using **PyTorch** to classify grayscale image data (such as FashionMNIST). It involves defining a CNN architecture, training the model using cross-entropy loss, and visualizing loss/accuracy trends.

### **Key Insights:**

* Built a minimal CNN with convolutional, ReLU, and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
* Trained on a standard dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
* Model performance evaluated on a test set with **accuracy** as the primary metric.
* Loss and accuracy were visualized over epochs to ensure training progression.
* Simple but effective architecture demonstrates the fundamental working of CNNs.
